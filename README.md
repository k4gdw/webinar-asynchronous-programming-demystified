Asynchronous Programming Demystified Demo Code
==============================================

This is my fork of the source code demonstrated in the "Asynchronous Programming
Demystified webinar from SubMain. [Click here][1] for more information.

What's the Difference?
----------------------

What's the difference between the original version of this source  code  and  my 
fork? Not much, at least not yet. All I've done so far is add the slides PDF  to
the repository and made a few changes to this README.md file.

Future Plans
------------

What else do I want to do with the repository that merited a fork?

 1.	A fork is the easiest way for me to play around with the code and  make  the
 	resulting code available to others while keeping my changes  separated  from
	the original code from SubMain's version 
 2. Also, it's entirely possible that I might want to submit a pull request. For
 	example, since I'm a VB.Net programmer, I might use create a VB.Net  version
	of the project.
	*	What's the worse that could happen if I were to submit a pull request to
		include the VB.Net version of the example code? Answer: The pull request
		gets ignored.
	*	The act of converting existing to another language,  such as VB.Net, has
		helped me to learn new stuff in the past.  Every  time  I  make  such  a 
		conversion by hand (instead of relying on a code converter) the exercise
		of trying to find the VB.Net equivalent to some edge C# construct drills
		the technique into my head.
	*	My C# skills are actually improved by the act of reading the  code  with
		enough understanding to translate it to my primary language.
